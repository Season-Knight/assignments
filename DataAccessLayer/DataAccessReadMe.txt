* Why are we using Promises here?
   * Promises help us to follow the path of each action for our CRUD app
* What benefits are there for breaking out these functions into their own resource? 
   * When its broken down into individual resources it makes it easier to follow to see where it breaks in order to fix any bugs
* What other functionality could you foresee leveraging this separation of concerns technique with?
   * This will help us to manage our databases and ensure that the correct information is getting passed to and from our application.
